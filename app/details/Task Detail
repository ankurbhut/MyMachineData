Android Test Assessment


**Task Description:**

**Problem Description:**

Create a simple Android application that fetches data from a public API endpoint and displays it in a paginated list format. However, the API response contains a large dataset, and each item in the list requires heavy computation to display additional details. Your task is to optimize the application using Android development best practices and ensure efficient rendering and data management.

**Requirements:**

1. **Data Fetching and Rendering:**
    - Fetch data from the provided API endpoint `https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts` with pagination support.
    - Display the fetched data in a RecyclerView or ListView component with pagination.
    - Each item in the list should display the fetched data, including `id` and `title` fields.

2. **Pagination:**
    - Implement pagination to fetch and display data in batches to enhance user experience and optimize performance.
    - Load more data as the user scrolls through the list.

3. **Heavy Computation Optimization:**
    - Each item in the list requires heavy computation to display additional details. Implement optimized algorithms to handle heavy computation efficiently.
    - Log the time taken for the heavy computation process.

4. **Callback Memoization:**
    - Create a detailed view for each item in the list that displays additional information when clicked.
    - Pass necessary data from the selected item to the detailed view using intents or other appropriate mechanisms.
    - Memoize callback functions to prevent unnecessary re-computation or re-rendering.

**Purpose:**

This task is designed to evaluate your Android development skills, including data fetching, pagination, optimization techniques, and adherence to best practices.

**Submission:**

Please complete the task locally on your Android development environment and record a short demo video showcasing your solution. After completing the task, upload your code to a public GitHub repository and provide us with the link along with the demo video.
